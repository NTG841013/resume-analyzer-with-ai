# Authentication Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the login and logout functionality for the AI Analyzer application. The implementation includes:

1. A login page at `/auth` route
2. Logout buttons positioned at the top-right corner of both the main navbar and the resume page
3. Authentication state management using the Puter API

## Implementation Details

### Authentication State Management

Authentication is managed through the `usePuterStore` Zustand store, which provides:

- `auth.isAuthenticated`: Boolean indicating if the user is authenticated
- `auth.signIn()`: Function to sign in
- `auth.signOut()`: Function to sign out
- `auth.user`: Contains user information when authenticated

The store initializes by checking authentication status on load and provides methods to manage authentication.

### Login Page

The login page is implemented in `app/routes/auth.tsx`. It provides:

- A simple UI with a login/logout button that changes based on authentication state
- Automatic redirection to the intended page after successful login
- Loading state during authentication

### Logout Buttons

Logout buttons have been added to:

1. **Main Navbar** (`app/components/Navbar.tsx`):
   - Positioned at the top-right corner, separate from the "Upload Resume/CV" button
   - Only visible when the user is authenticated
   - Styled with a red background to make it visually distinct

2. **Resume Page** (`app/routes/resume.tsx`):
   - Positioned at the top-right corner of the resume page's navigation bar
   - Styled consistently with the navbar logout button

Both logout buttons call `auth.signOut()` and navigate to the `/auth` page after logout.

## Testing

The login and logout functionality can be tested using the provided test script:

```bash
node test-auth.js
```

The test script verifies:

1. **Login Functionality**:
   - Navigation to the auth page
   - Clicking the login button
   - Authentication process
   - Redirection to the intended page
   - Authentication state update

2. **Logout Functionality**:
   - From the main navbar
   - From the resume page
   - Verification of auth.signOut() being called
   - Redirection to the auth page
   - Authentication state update

3. **Button Placement**:
   - Navbar logout button positioned at top right
   - Navbar logout button visually distinct from upload CV button
   - Resume page logout button positioned at top right

## Manual Testing Instructions

To manually test the login and logout functionality:

1. **Login Test**:
   - Navigate to the application
   - If not authenticated, you should be redirected to the auth page
   - Click the "Log In" button
   - Complete the authentication process
   - Verify you are redirected to the intended page
   - Verify the logout button appears in the top-right corner of the navbar

2. **Logout Test (Navbar)**:
   - While authenticated, navigate to any page with the navbar
   - Click the "Log Out" button in the top-right corner
   - Verify you are redirected to the auth page
   - Verify the authentication state is updated (login button appears)

3. **Logout Test (Resume Page)**:
   - While authenticated, navigate to a resume page
   - Click the "Log Out" button in the top-right corner
   - Verify you are redirected to the auth page
   - Verify the authentication state is updated (login button appears)

## Conclusion

The login and logout implementation meets all the requirements specified in the issue description:
- A proper login and logout process has been implemented
- The logout button is positioned at the top right of the screen, away from the upload CV element
- The logout button is visually distinct
- The functionality works correctly on both the main navbar and the resume page

All tests have passed, and the implementation is ready for use.
