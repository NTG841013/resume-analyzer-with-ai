# AI Analyzer Improvement Tasks

This document contains a comprehensive list of actionable improvement tasks for the AI Analyzer application. Tasks are organized by category and logically ordered by priority and dependency.

## Architecture and Structure

[ ] Implement a service layer to abstract Puter API interactions
[ ] Refactor state management with a more organized Zustand store structure
[ ] Create a dedicated API client for all external service interactions
[ ] Implement a more robust error handling strategy with error boundaries
[ ] Separate UI components from data fetching logic
[ ] Create a consistent loading state management pattern
[ ] Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for all API responses

## Code Quality and Maintainability

[ ] Refactor the upload.tsx component to separate concerns (file handling, form management, API calls)
[ ] Implement consistent error handling across all components
[ ] Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to all functions and components
[ ] Create utility functions for common operations (file handling, data formatting)
[ ] Implement proper form validation with error messages
[ ] Refactor nested conditional rendering with dedicated components
[ ] Standardize component props with proper TypeScript interfaces

## Performance Optimization

[ ] Implement caching for previously analyzed resumes
[ ] Optimize PDF processing with web workers
[ ] Implement lazy loading for route components
[ ] Add memoization for expensive computations
[ ] Optimize image loading with proper sizing and formats
[ ] Implement virtualization for long lists of suggestions
[ ] Add request debouncing for form submissions

## Testing

[ ] Set up Jest and React Testing Library for unit testing
[ ] Create unit tests for utility functions
[ ] Implement component tests for all UI components
[ ] Add integration tests for critical user flows
[ ] Create mock services for Puter API interactions in tests
[ ] Implement end-to-end tests with Cypress or Playwright
[ ] Set up continuous integration for automated testing

## Documentation

[ ] Create comprehensive README with setup and development instructions
[ ] Document the Puter API integration with examples
